This is the source code for my blog. 

As a reminder, here's how to post new stuff:

1. In RStudio, `Addins > New Post`. 
2. Put header images in `static/images`.
3. For in-line static images, enable Page Bundle mode, put the image in 
the same directory as the file, and use a Hugo short code, e.g.: 
`{{< figure src="myimg.png" title="My Title" >}}`.
4. `Addins > Serve Site` and make sure it looks good locally. (Doesn't work in
Posix Cloud, alas.)
5. Commit the code to GitHub.
6. Confirm it deployed via [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
