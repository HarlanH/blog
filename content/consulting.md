I help companies execute on ambitious technology goals.

# What I Do

I'm an AI PhD data scientist with expertise in machine learning, data systems, product development,
engineering management, and more. Here are several areas of depth:

* I help two-sided e-commerce marketplaces maximize sales using Generative AI, Search, Recommendations, and ML,
while balancing complex product and business demands.
* I implement high-impact e-commerce search systems (especially Algolia) that drive product discovery and business value.
* I build robust data, analytics, and metrics infrastructure for startups -- right the first time -- to maximize insights and business value.
* I do team development and hiring strategy for Data Science, AI, and Search organizations.

# How I Work

* I'm a freelance consultant, based in New York, NY (Eastern Time).
* I generally work and bill hourly, but can do flat-rate projects for a well-scoped effort.
* I can do everything from initial product discovery conversations and design, to implementation of well-designed, 
production-grade backend code.
