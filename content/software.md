# Software

I build small, donationware tools that others may find useful. This page highlights a few of them.

<div class="software-grid">
  <div class="software-item">
    <h2>NYTimes-ReSection</h2>
    <p>A Chrome extension that adds simple section-based navigation and structure to long New York Times articles.</p>
    <p><a href="/nytimes-resection-privacy/">Privacy policy for NYTimes-ReSection</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="software-item">
    <h2>OssaPlan</h2>
    <p>A small web app for building and sharing Opportunity-Solution Trees.</p>
    <p><a href="https://ossaplan.replit.app/">Open OssaPlan</a> (current URL, subject to change).</p>
  </div>
</div>
