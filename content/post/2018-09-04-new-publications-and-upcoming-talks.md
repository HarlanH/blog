Just a quick post here to note a few professional accomplishments:

1. I just added a new publication to my [vita](/publications/) -- a peer-reviewed conference proceeedings
article about abstractions for building repeated, related versions of similar predictive
models. Check out [some longer thoughts on Medium](https://medium.com/@HarlanH/an-architecture-and-domain-specific-language-framework-for-repeated-domain-specific-predictive-d36f63297d61), or read [the full article](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v82/harris18a).
2. Earlier this year, I added an _incredibly_ old project! [A paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00369/full) that I had contributed
a bit to in... 2005! finally got published! It has something to do with the way information
flows during speech perception... I think... 
3. I'll be talking at two Meetups this Fall -- the [RecSys NYC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/RecSys-New-York-City/events/250178750/) on Sept. 18th,
and the [Dataiku Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Analytics-Data-Science-by-Dataiku-NY/events/253949934/) on Sept. 26th. In both Meetups, I'll be talking about (different) aspects of recommendations systems
I'm building at [WayUp](http://wayup.com).
4. And I'll be talking at two conferences this Fall too -- the [Predictive APIs](https://www.papis.io/) conference 
in Boston in October, and [DataEngConf](https://www.dataengconf.com/no-bullshit-nyc) in NYC in November. At both of those conferences, I'll be talking about the software architecture aspects
of building job recommendation systems that need to provide compelling recommendations just
seconds after a user creates a rich profile.
