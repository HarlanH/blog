My newish cooking club had a dinner yesterday with the theme American Beer. I was tasked with dessert, and came up with this recipe for Pretzel Whoopie Pies. They turned out extremely well, so I thought I'd share the recipe here.

Ingredients:

* 2 egg yolks
* 1/2 c minus 1 T sugar
* 1 T light corn syrup
* 1/2 c finely ground unsalted mini pretzels
* 1/2 c cake flour
* 1 t baking powder
* 1/8 t salt
* 4 T butter, softened
* 1/3 c milk
* kosher salt
* 1 c stout beer (<a href="http://www.breckbrew.com/brews/vanilla-porter" target="_blank">Breckenridge Vanilla Porter</a> is excellent)
* 4 T butter, softened
* 8 oz powdered sugar

Recipe:

* Beat egg yolks, sugar, and corn syrup until lightened.
* Mix pretzel flour, cake flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat in butter and milk. Add to liquid mixture and mix thoroughly.
* Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes to hydrate evenly. Preheat oven to 350 F.
* Drop 12 evenly-shaped cookies onto a silpat-covered pan. A ring mold is helpful.  Sprinkle kosher salt over the top lightly.
* Bake about 14 minutes, until starting to brown around the edges, but still soft.
* Cool thoroughly on wire racks.
* Boil beer in a saucepan large enough to deal with foaming up, and reduce to 1/2 c. Cool to room temperature.
* Mix butter, powdered sugar, and reduced beer into a creamy, delicious frosting.
* Make sandwiches out of cookies and frosting.

Makes 6 whoopie pies.
