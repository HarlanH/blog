Second, your A/B test split *users*, but you're measuring *ratings*,
which are per-item. Some customers will buy multiple pairs of shoes, and
most likely will either rate all of them or none of them. Does this fact
affect how confident you can be at the end of the experiment?

# Randomization Unit Mis-Match

A/B tests are split at the user level, but ratings are per-item. Because of this,
the following facts cause a big problem:

1. Some users purchase more than one item at a time.
2. For users who purchase more than one item, the decision to rate
or not is usually all-or-nothing.
3. Some users are more generally positive and some users are more critical in their reviews.

Because of these facts, and because the feature change we’re A/B testing 
affects users, not individual items, _ratings by the same user are likely to be correlated_. 
But the standard ways of estimating uncertainty require that measurements
be [IID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables), and ratings are definitely not independent.
Almost any process you use to calculate uncertainty, including those provided
by _all_ on-line A/B test calculators,
will be too narrow, meaning that using those estimates will provide 
overly-confident levels of certainty, 
likely causing incorrect decisions to be made or learnings to be taken!

To solve this problem, we need to switch from closed-form estimates of uncertainty to bootstrap estimates. 
And, instead of sampling from ratings, we should instead sample from users. So, if user X in bucket A rated 3 items, 
the bootstrap samples would have 0, 3, or 6 (or potentially more) ratings from that user. Intuitively, sampling by 
users will increase the variance of the bootstrap samples, which is what we need to happen. 

Standard bootstrap packages don’t support this method of sampling, but fortunately it’s relatively easy to code. 

```{r boot}
# by is either "rating" or "user"
boot1 <- function(dd, by='rating') {
    # sample with replacement
    dd_samp <- if (by == 'rating') {
        slice_sample(dd, n=nrow(dd), replace=TRUE)
    } else {
        # sample user_ids with replacement
        # inner join to the df to get correct duplicated rows
        distinct_user_ids <- unique(dd$user_id)
        sample_user_ids <- sample(distinct_user_ids, length(distinct_user_ids), replace=TRUE)
        dd %>% inner_join(tibble(user_id = sample_user_ids), by='user_id')
    }
    
    # calculate the raw ratio
    a_ratings = dd_samp[['rating']][dd_samp['variant'] == 'test']
    b_ratings = dd_samp[['rating']][dd_samp['variant'] != 'test']

    n_a = length(a_ratings)
    n_b = length(b_ratings)
    p_a = sum(a_ratings == 5) / n_a
    p_b = sum(b_ratings == 5) / n_b
    p_b / p_a
}

n = 2000

# compute a bootstrap estimate, using rating as the sample unit
# ratios = map_dbl(1:n, ~ boot1(dat_ratings))
# rating_boot <- quantile(ratios, c(.025, .5, .975)) # same as closed-form above!
# res_df <- res_df %>% bind_rows(tibble(Method='Per-Rating (Bootstrap)', lb=rating_boot[[1]], med=rating_boot[[2]], ub=rating_boot[[3]]))

# compute a bootstrap estimate, using user as the sample unit
# ratios_user = map_dbl(1:n, ~ boot1(dat_ratings, by='user'))
# user_boot <- quantile(ratios_user, c(.025, .5, .975)) # same as closed-form above!
# res_df <- res_df %>% bind_rows(tibble(Method='Per-User (Bootstrap)', lb=user_boot[[1]], med=user_boot[[2]], ub=user_boot[[3]]))
