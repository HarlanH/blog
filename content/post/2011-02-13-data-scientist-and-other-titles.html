<p>Neil Saunders has an interesting (to me) blog post up this morning, with the title “<a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/dumped-on-by-data-scientists/">Dumped on by data scientists</a>.” He uses the use of “data scientist” in a <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Dumped-On-by-Data-Scientists/126324/">Chronicle of Higher Ed article</a> to rant a little bit about the term. For Neil, it’s redundant, as the act of doing science necessarily requires data; it’s insulting, as if “scientist” wasn’t cool enough and you have to add “data”; and it’s misleading, as many people who call themselves “data scientists” are actually dealing with business data rather than scientific data.</p>
<p>Without disagreeing that there’s a terminological sprawl going on, I did want to address the use of the term, and partially disagree with Neil.</p>
<p>As someone with scientific training who uses those tools to solve business problems, I certainly struggle with a description of my role. “Data Scientist” or “Statistical Data Scientist” is actually pretty good, as it correctly indicates that I use scientific techniques (controlled experiments, sophisticated statistics) to understand our company’s data. I often describe myself as a “Statistician”, too, which gets across some of the same ideas without people having to do a double take and parse a new phrase. I also sometimes describe myself as doing “Operations Research” (aka “Management Science”, although I don’t use that term), since I use some of the tools of that field, as well as of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, to optimize certain objective functions.</p>
<p>“Business Intelligence” actually is not that good a term for what I do, as most of what is usually called BI is about tools for better/more relevant/faster access to data for business people to use. This is not a bad thing to be doing, at all, but it’s different from the predictive and inferential statistical methods that I use in my job.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the right answer is. It might depend on the precise person and their precise role. My title, for instance, is the result of a back-and-forth with my boss, HR, and others, trying to find words that have both appropriate internal and external meanings. “Technical Lead” is a rank, indicating that I run technical projects without (formally) managing people. “Inventory Optimization and Research” covers a variety of areas. “Inventory” here means “sellable units”, like boxes on a shelf, or in this case, like scheduled airline flights. Probably baffling for an external audience without an explanation, but extremely clear inside the company. “Optimization” means what it sounds like, both in a technical and a non-technical sense, and for both internal and external audiences. “Research” indicates a focus on the development of long-term and cutting-edge systems. “Data Scientist” didn’t end up in there, but it could have.</p>
<p>For people using Big Data tools and scientific methods to study topics inside academia, the right answer seems to me to put the field of study first. You’re not a “Data Scientist”, you’re an astrophysicist, or a bioinformatician, or a neuroscientist, with a specialization in statistical methods. If you’re a generalist inside the academy, you’re probably a statistician. Perhaps “Data Scientist” should be restricted to people applying scientific tools and techniques to problems of non-academic interest? That might work, as long as it included people who do things like apply predictive analytic tools to hospital admissions data.</p>
