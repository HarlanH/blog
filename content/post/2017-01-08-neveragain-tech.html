<p>I, Harlan D. Harris, hereby commit to the <a href="http://neveragain.tech/">neveragain.tech</a> pledge. Please stand with me and hold me to it.</p>
It starts:
<blockquote>
We, the undersigned, are employees of tech organizations and companies based in the United States. We are engineers, designers, business executives, and others whose jobs include managing or processing data about people. We are choosing to stand in solidarity with Muslim Americans, immigrants, and all people whose lives and livelihoods are threatened by the incoming administrationâ€™s proposed data collection policies. We refuse to build a database of people based on their Constitutionally-protected religious beliefs. We refuse to facilitate mass deportations of people the government believes to be undesirable.
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://neveragain.tech/action.html">Per the neveragain.tech web site</a>, they no longer add signatures to the site, but instead ask people to post a commitment on a personal blog or Twitter, which I have done here.</p>
