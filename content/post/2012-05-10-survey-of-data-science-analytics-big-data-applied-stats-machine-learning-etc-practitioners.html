<p><a title="Data Science, Moore’s Law, and Moneyball" href="http://www.harlan.harris.name/2011/09/data-science-moores-law-and-moneyball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As I’ve discussed here before</a>, there is a debate raging (ok, maybe not raging) about terms such as “data science”, “analytics”, “data mining”, and “big data”. What do they mean, how do they overlap, and perhaps most importantly, who are the people who work in these fields?</p>
<p>Along with two other DC-area Data Scientists, Marck Vaisman and Sean Murphy, I’ve put together a survey to explore some of these issues. Help us quantitatively understand the space of data-related skills and careers by participating!</p>

<p>It should take 10 minutes or less, data will be kept confidential, and we look forward to sharing our results and insights in a variety of venues, including this blog! Thanks!</p>
