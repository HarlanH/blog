I've been cooking a recipe recently of my own creation that I really like,
and there isn't much similar on the internet, so I'm sharing the recipe here. 
It's a combination
of two great things -- hot-smoking fish with wood chips in a 
[stovetop smoker](https://cameronsproducts.com/product-category/smoking/stovetop-smokers/), 
and the 
fermented flavors of Hunanese cuisine.

Smoked fish and duck are common flavors in Chinese cooking. 
[Tea-smoked duck](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=tea+smoked+duck&find_loc=New+York,+NY) 
is common
on Chinese menus in America, and Chinese cookbooks have recipes like
[Steamed Smoked Fish with Black Beans and Chiles](https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/72638/steamed-smoked-fish-with-black). 
But those recipes typically suggest purchasing a smoked trout or similar, and
adding additional ingredients. I've had great luck starting with raw fish. There
are a few [examples](https://carolynjphillips.blogspot.com/2015/05/smoked-fish-hunan-way.html)
of similar techniques, but not that many. 

Here's what I do. I'm not using [my technique for rewriting recipes](http://www.harlan.harris.name/2018/03/how-i-rewrite-recipes/) here, as I want to explain
some of the details of the process.

## Stovetop Smoked Chinese Fish

Serves 2-3, with other dishes. Takes 30 minutes.

### Things You'll Need

* a stovetop smoker and wood chips -- I have the mini Cameron's smoker; oak chips are good for this
* 1 whole fish of 1 pound or so, scaled and cleaned, or a meaty skin-on filet -- trout is good
* oil -- [scallion oil](https://food52.com/recipes/70013-scallion-oil-chinese-mother-sauce-1) is highly recommended
* Shaoxing rice wine

Some or all of:

* scallions, in 2" chunks
* fermented Chinese black beans
* chopped [salt-fermented Hunanese chiles](http://www.tigersandstrawberries.com/2007/08/15/homemade-hunan-salted-chilies/), or dried whole red chiles
* thinly julienned young ginger

### Procedure

1. With a sharp knife, cut diagonal slashes through the skin of the fish. 
If needed for the fish to fit in the smoker, cut off the tail. Douse the fish with
shao-xing wine, and let it sit on a plate. In Chinese cooking, this is common for 
reducing "fishy flavors".
2. Prep scallions, ginger, etc.
3. Rinse fish and pat dry with paper towels. Lightly cover fish with oil.
Lightly salt the inside of the fish (the outside will have plenty of salt from
the black beans and chiles).
4. Cover the smoker tray with aluminum foil, then put the grate on the tray.
Put the fish on the grate. Put some of the scallion chunks inside the fish.
On top of the fish, put more scallions, fermented black beans, and chiles. Drizzle
with a bit more oil. (See below for what it looks like.)
5. Put a heaping tablespoon of wood chips in the smoker. Put the tray of fish in the
smoker.
6. Put the smoker on a hot flame, with the cover cracked, just until wisps of smoke 
start to come out. Turn the heat to medium-low, close the cover, and set a timer for
20 minutes (for a whole fish; less for a filet).
7. Serve family style on a platter, with rice and contrasting other dishes.
