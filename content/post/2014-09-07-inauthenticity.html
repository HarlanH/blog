<p>Let me unpack that a bit…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/741639594/hugh-and-crye-fitted-t-shirts-made-in-the-usa"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/386/210/d8b033bb3e9e4356647f79f071efe07f_large.jpg?1407188455" alt="" width="359" height="347" /></a> <em>Hugh and Crye t-shirt</em></p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.hughandcrye.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugh &amp; Crye</a>, a DC-based clothing firm for men, with a novel take on sizing, recently did <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/741639594/hugh-and-crye-fitted-t-shirts-made-in-the-usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Kickstarter campaign</a> for their new line of fitted t-shirts. What the hell? H&amp;C has been around for about 5 years, and based on their product growth and <a href="http://www.elevationdcmedia.com/innovationnews/hughandcrye_08132014.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring</a> seems to be doing quite well. I like their stuff. Why do they need a Kickstarter? The original goal of Kickstarter was to “kickstart” new products by providing crowdsourced seed funding so that you (you!) can ensure that a great idea gets off the ground. And if a project doesn’t make its goals, no harm done, and no money wasted. A fantastic example is the Oculus Rift, which was a Kickstarted Virtual Reality rig, and is now a subsidiary of Facebook. Kickstarting a project is a rather labor-intensive alternative to trying to get a bank loan, or maxing out your credit cards, but with much less risk. It’s a very community-driven, authentic way of getting support for a new venture, moving it from the prototype phase to the initial manufacturing round.</p>

<p>Does any of this apply to Hugh &amp; Crye? Do they need free money from the community? No, they’re clearly cash-flow positive and could get a bank loan. Do they need help figuring out manufacturing? No, clearly not. Was there any doubt that their loyal customers would fail to buy t-shirts, where the all-or-nothing nature of a Kickstarter would provide them with better understanding of the market? Heck no – they’ve been doing market research on this for years. Will the amount of money they get actually help their operations move faster? They made $53,151 – probably not.</p>
<p>So why are they doing it? To drum up buzz – that’s it. It’s advertising for a done-deal. Kickstarter is not a platform for advertising. The campaign is inauthentic and annoying.</p>
<p>(But I still supported it, because I wanted to try one of their t-shirts.)</p>

<p>Highly related issue: food trucks from big companies. Chick-fil-A, the chicken sandwich chain, has food trucks that have drawn lots of controversy. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/chick-fil-a_n_1382401.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some of that is because of the company’s politics</a>. But if you read comments on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OhMyGogi/posts/330278353731042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook </a>and Twitter, a fair amount of the criticism is because they’re inauthentic – that they’re cheapening the authentic experience of trying someone’s labor of love. That they’re insulting your hope that your favorite food truck will be successful enough to <a href="http://newcolumbiaheights.blogspot.com/2012/04/porc-foodtrucks-restaurant-gets-name.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open a sit-down restaurant</a>.</p>
<p>It’s inauthentic and annoying.</p>
<p>Do you have other examples that get your goat? Please leave a comment!</p>
<p>To close, for a great take on authenticity, you should definitely watch this great video from my new favorite YouTube Channel, the boringly-named but completely awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LqW4ijMoENQ2Wv17ZrFJA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PBS Idea Channel</a>:</p>
