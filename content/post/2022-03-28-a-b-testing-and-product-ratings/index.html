<p>TODO: grab an image of a shoe?</p>
<p>For certain changes to an e-commerce web site, we’d like to understand not just
whether users <em>purchase more</em>, but also whether they’re more <em>satisfied</em> with the
items they purchase.
There are several ways we could potentially measure this, such
as return-to-site rate, complaint or refund rate, etc. But the most straightforward
way is to look at the ratings that users provide.</p>
<p>Suppose that you run a web site that sells shoes, and you want to test some sort
of interface change. You may suspect that it won’t affect how <em>many</em> items
are purchased, but instead will affect <em>which</em> items are purchased, and in
turn will affect <em>satisfaction</em>.
As you’re a savvy product analyst, you decide to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B test</a>
the interface change, showing half of your users the old version, and half of
your users the new version. After a few weeks, you can look at what those
users did, and make a decision to keep the interface chance, or to roll it back.</p>
<p>There are two problems, though. First, ratings accumulate slowly over time, and
most people don’t rate their purchases. This means that whatever you
measure at the end of your experiment is only an approximation to the
underlying satisfaction of your customers. Can you use this biased estimate
to make a good decision?</p>
<p>Second, your A/B test split <em>users</em>, but you’re measuring <em>ratings</em>, which
are per-item. Some customers will buy multiple pairs of shoes, and most likely
will either rate all of them or none of them. Does this fact affect how
confident you can be at the end of the experiment?</p>
<p>TODO: diagram?</p>
<div id="delayed-and-biased-ratings" class="section level1">
<h1>Delayed and Biased Ratings</h1>
<p>The first issue is that ratings are <em>delayed</em> and <em>incomplete</em> metrics.
If you order shoes from a web site, the earliest you’ll rate the item would
be when you receive it, and more likely you’d rate it only after several days or
weeks. And you might only rate it three months later, when you log back into the
web site and are reminded of your past orders.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you might be more willing to rate some items more than others.
Higher-priced items, where you spent a bunch of time reading reviews, might
lead to a higher likelihood to rate. Items that were defective on arrival,
or that were very disappointing, might lead to early, negative ratings.</p>
<p>All of these complexities affect A/B tests.</p>
<p>simulate a scenario where the A/B test doesn’t affect the purchase rate (assuming 1 item per user),
but does affect the underlying satisfaction rate, which affects rating rate and rating timing in a U-shaped manner.</p>
<p>mention RTR and StitchFix and similar subscription services have insanely high rating rates</p>
<p>plot the accumulated average rating, rating rate, and distribution, over time, from the start of the experiment
through much past the end</p>

<div id="randomization-unit-mis-match" class="section level1">
<h1>Randomization Unit Mis-Match</h1>
<p>A/B tests are split at the user level, but ratings are per-item. Because some users purchase more than one item
(and the descision to rate or not is usually all or nothing),
some users are more generally positive or critical in their reviews,
and the feature change we’re A/B testing affects users, not the resources,
ratings by the same user are likely to be correlated.
This means that standard estimates of uncertainty (such as those provided by all on-line A/B test calculators)
will be too narrow, meaning that using those estimates will provide overly-confident levels of certainty,
likely causing incorrect decisions to be made or learnings to be taken.</p>
<p>Making uncertainty even worse is the randomization mis-match issue described above, where we split users but measure per-resource ratings. Technically, this means that the IID assumption used in calculation of uncertainty intervals is violated, as ratings are not independently drawn.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we need to switch from closed-form estimates of uncertainty to bootstrap estimates.
And, instead of sampling from ratings, we should instead sample from users. So, if user X in bucket A rated 3 items,
the bootstrap samples would have 0, 3, or 6 (or potentially more) ratings from that user. Intuitively, sampling by
users will increase the variance of the bootstrap samples, which is what we need to happen.</p>
<p>Standard bootstrap packages don’t support this method of sampling, but fortunately it’s relatively easy to code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># by is either &quot;rating&quot; or &quot;user&quot;
boot1 &lt;- function(dd, by=&#39;rating&#39;) {
    # sample with replacement
    dd_samp &lt;- if (by == &#39;rating&#39;) {
        slice_sample(dd, n=nrow(dd), replace=TRUE)
    } else {
        # sample user_ids with replacement
        # inner join to the df to get correct duplicated rows
        distinct_user_ids &lt;- unique(dd$user_id)
        sample_user_ids &lt;- sample(distinct_user_ids, length(distinct_user_ids), replace=TRUE)
        dd %&gt;% inner_join(tibble(user_id = sample_user_ids), by=&#39;user_id&#39;)
    }
    
    # calculate the raw ratio
    a_ratings = dd_samp[[&#39;rating&#39;]][dd_samp[&#39;variant&#39;] == &#39;test&#39;]
    b_ratings = dd_samp[[&#39;rating&#39;]][dd_samp[&#39;variant&#39;] != &#39;test&#39;]

    n_a = length(a_ratings)
    n_b = length(b_ratings)
    p_a = sum(a_ratings == 5) / n_a
    p_b = sum(b_ratings == 5) / n_b
    p_b / p_a
}

n = 2000

<h1>True Causality and Guidance</h1>
<p>It’s also worth noting the various mechanisms that an A/B-tested intervention could have on ratings.</p>
<p>The intervention could increase purchase rate or could change the item mix.</p>
<p>The intervention could directly, or indirectly (via purchase rate or item mix), affect the true satisfaction of items acquired. We cannot directly see true satisfaction.</p>
<p>The intervention could directly or indirectly (via satisfaction) affect the rate at which items are rated, either by affecting the eventual asymptotic rate, or changing the timing of ratings.</p>
<p>The intervention could directly or indirectly (via the above factors) affect the rating given.</p>
<p>This is a complex causal network, and different interventions (e.g., changes to resource impressions by Search or Recommendations changes, or UX design; changes to rating UI/UX or review policy; etc) will affect this chain of effects differently. It’s important to take rating metrics with a grain of salt, even when using the above techniques of delay and bootstrapped estimates. It’s possible that effects of some interventions will be improperly measured, and/or it may be necessary to use different measurement or statistical techniques to understand true satisfaction.</p>
